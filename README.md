# Translation-Augmented-LibriSpeech-Corpus
==========================================

This project is an adaptation of LibriSpeech ASR Corpus which is a corpus of approximatively 1000 hours of speech aligned with their transcriptions (LibriSpeech: an ASR corpus based on public domain audio books", Vassil Panayotov, Guoguo Chen, Daniel Povey and Sanjeev Khudanpur, ICASSP 2015) for speech translation systems.

Introduction
============

Our corpus is an extension of the MSCOCO image recognition and captioning dataset. MSCOCO comprises images paired with a set of five captions. Yet, it does not include any speech. Therefore, we used `Voxygen's text-to-speech system <https://www.voxygen.fr/>`_ to synthesised the available captions. 

The addition of speech as a new modality enables MSCOCO to be used for researches in the field of language acquisition, unsupervised term discovery, keyword spotting, or semantic embedding using speech and vision.
